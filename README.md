Repro for the JP Morgan Coding Challenge

## Problem Statement

Coding Challenge: NYC Schools

**GOAL**: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions

### REQUIREMENTS:
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will
be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don&#39;t worry about finding &quot;the&quot; solution. Feel
free to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code).
Create a native app to provide information on NYC High schools.

Display a list of NYC High Schools.
1. Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-

3. It is up to you to decide what additional information to display
When creating a name for your project, please use the following naming convention:
YYYYMMDD-[First&amp;LastName]-NYCSchools (Example: 20180101-DanielleBordner-NYCSchools)
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to
prioritize the following:

### What is Important
- Proper function – requirements met.
- Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or
workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to
wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
- Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
- Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

### What is Less Important
- Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
Bonus Points!
- Unit Tests
- Additional functionality – whatever you see fit.

### Android:
- Make sure you are correctly handing any necessary permissions.
- Please make sure you are using Java. If you want to demonstrate the use of Kotlin, we&#39;d
rather you use a combination of both.
- Use Java as the primary language. You can show case your skills in Kotlin if you would
like to.
As mentioned, you are not expected to function in a vacuum. Use all the online resources you
can find, and please do contact us with questions or for interim feedback if you desire.
