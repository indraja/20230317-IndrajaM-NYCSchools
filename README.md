*JPMC - Android Coding Challenge: NYC Schools*

### REQUIREMENTS:


- The app requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be
happy with any of a wide variety of functional solutions. Feel free to be creative and impress with
code and UX (see more details down). You are allowed to use all the online resources you can find
and use any 3rd party library if desired. Remember to make it useful for an actual user/student.
Create a native app (no react-native and no flutter) to provide information on NYC High schools.

## Display a list of NYC High Schools.
1. Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-
Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2
2. Selecting a school should show additional information about the school
 1. Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing.
 2. SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4
 3. It is up to you to decide what additional information to display.
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:

### What is Important
- Meet the basic App requirements.
- The App should work like it would do in production â€“ error handling, edge conditions, stability
and speed is important.
- Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or
workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to
wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
- Proper architecture with of separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
- Modern asynchronous programming techniques.
What is Less Important
- Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
- Only add code which you want us to read and judge you.
Bonus Points!
- Good UX and UI
- Use of MVVM Architecture
- Samples of Unit testing. One of each kind rather than 100% code coverage.
- Kotlin and related tools are preferred but not mandatory.
- Use of Dependency injection.
How to Submit:
- Submit your code via Gitlab.com. Feel free to use your current account or create a free
account.
- When creating a name for your project, please use the following naming convention:
o YYYYMMDD-[First&LastName]-NYCSchools (Example: 20180101-DanielleBordner-
NYCSchools)
- Make the project public and send the link back to the person that sent you the test.
- Please do contact us with questions or for interim feedback if you desire
